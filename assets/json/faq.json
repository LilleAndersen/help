    "question": "How do I link a file to my html?",
    "answer" : "If you want to link a file to your html you should either use the head or the bottom of the page depending on the filetype. For CSS you place this: \"<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"pathtofile\">\", in your head tag and change the href to the .css file path. For JavaScript you generally place it at the bottom of the page like this: \"<script src=\"pathtofile\"></script>\". Make sure you place the JS src inside the body tag. Remember: webpages will always load the first JS file first, so if you have any libraries or code which depends on other files, make sure you place them in the correct order."
