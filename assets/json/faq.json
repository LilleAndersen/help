        "question": "How do I link a file to my html?",
        "answer" : "If you want to link a file to your html, you should link it either the head or the bottom of the body tag depending on the filetype. For stylesheets you use the <b>link</b> tag in your head tag and set the href to the .css file path. For JavaScript you generally place it at the bottom of the body with a script tag. Make sure you place it inside the body tag. Remember: html will always load the first JS file first, so if you have any libraries or code which depends on other files, make sure you place them in the correct order."
