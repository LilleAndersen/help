                <p>
                    We are a group of incredibly smart individuals. We are the type to look down on others for using VS
                    Code. For legal reasons that's a joke. We are in our second year of studying information technology.
                    We are highly motivated, and we like to joke a lot. Mostly about things that shouldn't be joked
                    about. We enjoy: programming, vibing together and gaming. You can find
                    more about us and the rest of our class at our page <a href="https://yessness.com/">https://yessness.com/</a>
